🎯 Personal Expense Tracker System Using Python  
📊 Budget Monitoring & Expense Insights for Everyday Users

---

📌 Project Overview  
This project is a command-line **Personal Expense Tracker** developed in **Python**, integrated with **MySQL** for database management and **Matplotlib** for visual insights. It allows users to manage their expenses, monitor category-wise budgets, and visualize their spending habits.

It includes core features like:  
💸 Amount | 📅 Date | 🧾 Description | 🗂 Category | 🎯 Budget | 📊 Visual Reports

**Goal:** Build a practical tool that empowers users to take control of their finances by tracking expenses, setting budgets, and making data-driven personal finance decisions.

🎯 Objectives  
📝 Add, update, and delete daily expenses  
📆 Filter and view expenses by month/year  
🎯 Set budget limits for each category  
⚠ Get real-time alerts when budgets are exceeded  
📊 Visualize trends to understand where money goes

---

🧹 Data Validation & Processing  
❌ **Input Validation:** Prevents invalid entries for date, amount, category, and description  
📅 **Date Parsing:** Ensures correct date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for filtering and aggregation  
💬 **Category/Description Cleaning:** Accepts only meaningful, clean text  
🛠 **Real-time SQL Updates:** All data is stored and updated directly in MySQL  
📊 **Plotting Data:** Uses grouped data to generate dynamic visuals with Matplotlib

✅ Key Takeaways  
This project simulates a real-world expense monitoring system with integrated **budget tracking**. It helped me sharpen my skills in backend integration, user input validation, and **data storytelling through visuals**. It's a great demonstration of how technical tools can solve practical everyday problems.

📈 Budget alerts • 📅 Filtered summaries • 📊 Spending analysis — all from a simple command-line interface.

🌟 Why This Project Stands Out  
💡 Real-world financial use case  
🛠 Built from scratch with Python and MySQL  
📊 Visual-driven insights using Matplotlib  
⚙ Combines backend, logic, and reporting  
🎯 End-to-end workflow: from input to insight

---

📁 Dataset Source  
User inputs via CLI — no external dataset required.  
All data is stored and managed dynamically within a **MySQL database**.
